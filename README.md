# OpenOJP

OpenOJP is a mod for Star Wars Jedi Knight: Jedi Academy based on the OpenJK engine, porting the full feature set of the **Open Jedi Project (OJP) Enhanced** into a modern, maintained codebase.

## Direction

OpenOJP is focused on **bug fixing, minor tweaks, and quality-of-life improvements** to the OJP Enhanced experience. This is a community-maintained project that aims to keep OJP's unique gameplay alive and stable.

This is **not** a replacement for MovieBattles 2 or any other large-scale modification. OpenOJP preserves the core Jedi Academy gameplay with OJP's enhancements — improved saber combat, dodge mechanics, bot AI, and game mode additions — without redefining the game into something entirely new.

Contributions are welcome. If you find a bug or have a small improvement, feel free to open an issue or pull request.
